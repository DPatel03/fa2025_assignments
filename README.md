## About This Repository

This repository serves as a documented archive of my work for CDS 701. The primary goal is to provide a clean and organized showcase of the practical skills acquired throughout the course, from fundamental data processing with **Pandas** to building predictive models with **Scikit-learn**. Each assignment is self-contained and reflects the specific concepts covered in the curriculum.

## Assignments Overview

Below is a summary of each completed assignment and the key topics covered.

| Assignment | Folder | Topics Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Homework 01** | `homework01/` | **Data Manipulation & ML Intro:** Data loading, preprocessing, EDA with Pandas, and an introduction to model training/evaluation using Scikit-learn's Logistic Regression. |
| **Homework 02** | `homework02/` | **Probability & Statistics:** Core concepts including conditional probability, random variables, common distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Gaussian), and distance metrics. |
| **Homework 03** | `homework03/` |  **NumPy & Linear Algebra:** An introduction to NumPy for numerical computing, covering vector/matrix operations, broadcasting, and fundamental linear algebra concepts like matrix decompositions (Eigen, SVD). |
